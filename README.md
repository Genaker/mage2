# Mage is a Magento 2 library that makes magento backend easy again

**\Mage::** Facades provide an old good static interface to Magento classes that are available in the applicationâ€™s Mage service container (a place to store variables and objects to use them when needed). This means that we can use functions without making an object from a class.
Facades provide a "static" interface to classes available in the application's service container. Mage ships with many facades provide access to all Magento 2 features.

Mage facades serve as "static proxies" to underlying classes in the service container, providing the benefit of a terse, expressive syntax while maintaining more flexibility than traditional magento methods.

# Mage library is not only facades!

Magento 2 sucks, and Mage is here to resolve this issue. Adobe killed Magento with the scum and overengenered bloatware. Mage adding additional nice development features not available with Magento 2 core.
* Fast easy accesible fasades
* Easy Logger
* Fast, accessible Object manager
* Symfony Dumper features
* Kint Backtrace and Debug
* Eloquent/Laravel Query Builder and ORM (powered by Laragento)

# Advantages of the Mage::Facades

* improve the readability and usability by masking interaction with more complex components behind a single and often simplified API
* provide a context-specific interface to more generic functionality
* serve as a launching point for a broader refactor of monolithic or tightly-coupled Magento systems in favor of more loosely-coupled code

We have decided to use a facade design pattern because the magento 2 system is very overengenered/complex and obfuscated - difficult to understand because the system has many interdependent classes. The mage::facade pattern hides the complexities of the Magento 2 system and provides a simpler interface to the developers. It typically involves a single wrapper class containing a set of members the client requires. These members access the system on behalf of the facade clients and hide the implementation details.

# Mage DB2 facade powered by Laravel query builder

Magento 2 uses an outdated Zend_DB library to implement a slow legacy ORM and interact with a database. Mage DB2, based on Laravel/DB, makes work with databases extremely simple and fast using raw SQL, a fluent Laravel query builder, and the Eloquent ORM in conjunction with the Laragento package.

Also, Laravel collections provide a variety of extremely powerful methods for mapping and reducing data. For more information, check the awesome Laravel documentation.

## Several examples:
Get all dates from the order table
```
$orders = DB2::table('sales_order');
```
## Specify select statements 
```
$users = DB2::table('users')
            ->select('name', 'email as user_email')
            ->get();
```
## Join
```
$users = DB2::table('users')
            ->join('contacts', 'users.id', '=', 'contacts.user_id')
            ->join('orders', 'users.id', '=', 'orders.user_id')
            ->select('users.*', 'contacts.phone', 'orders.price')
            ->get();
```
## Insert
```
DB2::table('users')->insert([
    ['email' => 'picard@example.com', 'votes' => 0],
    ['email' => 'janeway@example.com', 'votes' => 0],
]);
```
